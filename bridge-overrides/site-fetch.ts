/**
 * Native site transport for the Tauri MOBILE shell - the platform seam only.
 *
 * Replaces the web shell's `shells/web/src/bridge/site-fetch.ts` at build time
 * via the resolveId override in vite.config.js, exactly as state.ts replaces the
 * IndexedDB state bridge. The web module is the one that does NOT have a
 * transport: on a plain PWA the Design System studio never renders the Website
 * tile at all, because a browser page cannot fetch a third-party origin
 * (plans/97 section 9 - connect-src allowlists six hosts, and the decision is that no
 * server fetch is ever built for this).
 *
 * Mobile DOES ship this, unlike page capture: capture needs a headless Chrome
 * this shell has no way to run, so mobile deliberately omits the 'capture'
 * capability and inherits the throwing stub. A site fetch needs only an HTTP
 * client, which tauri-plugin-http already gives both shells, so there is no
 * reason for a phone to be the one device that cannot read a website.
 *
 * All the logic lives in ../../tauri-shared/bridge-overrides/site-fetch.ts,
 * shared with the desktop shell. What is left here is the `@tauri-apps/api`
 * binding: this shell owns that dependency (the Tauri shells are not npm
 * workspaces, so the parent repo cannot resolve it), and this is where any
 * mobile-only behaviour would go - a shorter default timeout on a metered
 * connection, say.
 *
 * WIRING, AS OF 2026-08-09: nothing imports this yet. The web shell's Website
 * source finds the native transport through a RUNTIME probe of Tauri's own
 * `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` global (detectSiteTransport in
 * shells/web/src/lib/design-system/sources/website.ts), which is why the tile
 * appears on this shell at all. The build-time override below needs a
 * `shells/web/src/bridge/site-fetch.ts` to intercept and there is none, so the
 * vite map key matches nothing. This file is the seam for when there is one:
 * its job then is to publish the transport as `host.net._siteFetch`, the
 * optional bridge member website.ts probes before the global.
 *
 * The command it invokes is src-tauri/src/site_fetch.rs, registered in this
 * shell's invoke handler (src-tauri/src/lib.rs).
