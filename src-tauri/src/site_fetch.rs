//! Native site fetch — transport 1 of the Design System studio's website source
//! (plans/97 section 9 / SS9).
//!
//! The deployed PWA cannot fetch a third-party origin at all: `connect-src`
//! allowlists six hosts, so a website ingest dies at CSP before CORS is even
//! asked. The decision recorded in plan 97 section 9 is that no server-side fetch is
//! ever built for it — so the feature exists ONLY where a real transport does,
//! and this is one of the two (the other is the Chrome extension). Nothing here
//! is a fallback for the web shell; the web shell simply does not offer the
//! source.
//!
//! WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES, AND DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//!   • GET one page — the FIRST-PARTY url the user typed and pressed a button
//!     for. There is no crawl: no link following, no sitemap, no second page.
//!   • Follow only SAME-PARTY redirects (see `same_party`), at most
//!     MAX_REDIRECTS of them. A redirect that leaves the host, or downgrades
//!     https to http, fails the call rather than silently fetching somewhere the
//!     user did not consent to.
//!   • Fetch the stylesheets the page links, and the icon/og-image hrefs, under
//!     hard count/byte caps and one overall deadline.
//!   • PARSE NOTHING. The raw HTML and the raw stylesheet text go back to the
//!     client, where shells/web/src/lib/design-system/extract-site.ts — the pure,
//!     transport-agnostic, fixture-tested parser both transports share — reads
//!     them. The tag scan below exists only to know WHICH subresources to fetch;
//!     it is not the parser and must never grow into one. Keeping one parser is
//!     what stops the native and extension transports drifting apart.
//!
//! CONSENT
//! The button in the studio is the consent, and it states what will be read and
//! by what before it is pressed. Nothing here runs at boot, on a deep link, or
//! on a keystroke: `?source=url&u=` only prefills the field. This command is
//! reachable only from an explicit press.
//!
//! COOKIES / IDENTITY
//! The clients below are built fresh per call with no cookie store, so the fetch
//! carries none of the user's sessions. It is an anonymous read of a public page,
//! not a logged-in one, and a page behind a login will come back as its logged-out
//! form (or a redirect this command refuses). Better honest than surprising.
//!
//! ON SUBRESOURCE ADDRESSES (the residual, stated plainly)
//! Stylesheet and icon URLs come from the PAGE, not the user, and a stylesheet on
//! a CDN is normal enough that restricting subresources to the first party would
//! break most real sites. So they may be cross-origin. Bounds: http(s) only, no
//! https→http downgrade, hard count + byte caps, one deadline, no cookies, and
//! the bytes never leave the device (there is no server in this feature at all).
//! What remains is that a hostile page can make the app issue a bounded GET to an
//! address of its choosing, whose response reaches only the user's own machine.
//! Same posture as the desktop shell capture.rs SSRF note: this is a local app the user pointed
//! at a URL. If that ever needs tightening, `subresource_allowed` is the one
//! function to change.
//!
//! TWIN FILE — KEEP IN SYNC
//! shells/tauri-desktop/src-tauri/src/site_fetch.rs is a byte-identical copy. The
//! two Tauri shells are separate submodule repos and neither may depend on the
//! other, and unlike the TS side (shells/tauri-shared/bridge-overrides/, which
//! the parent repo owns and both shells import) there is no shared Rust crate to
//! put this in. Any edit here must be applied there in the same change.
